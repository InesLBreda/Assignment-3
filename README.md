http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Files:
- CodeBook.md a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data

- Load&Import.R loads the required packages, downloads the data files to the working directory (if needed) and imports the data files to R. 

- run_analysis.R executes the 5 steps described in the assignment of the course:
Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

- finaldata.txt is the data obtained after run_analysis.R
